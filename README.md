Status: ACTIVE

Classification: IT Portfolio & Home Lab Dashboard

Core Engine: Next.js 15 (Turbopack)

This project is a high-performance Production Node serving as both a professional portfolio and a live telemetry dashboard for my home lab infrastructure. It bridges the gap between web deployment and bare-metal systems administration.

🧠 INTEGRATED_INTELLIGENCE (AI)
The system is integrated with local AI inference to demonstrate computing capabilities.

Model: DeepSeek-R1

Hardware: Dedicated RTX A2000 6GB

Implementation: Local LLM integration for real-time data processing.

🛰️ NETWORK_AWARENESS (Pi-hole)
This portfolio functions as a frontend for my local network security stack.

Telemetry: Live data fetching from Pi-hole API.

Metrics: Monitoring DNS queries, blocked ads, and network health directly through the dashboard interface.

Edge Security: Traffic routed through pfSense and hardened via Cloudflare Tunnels.

🏗️ INFRASTRUCTURE_STACK
The "Website" is actually a containerized deployment within a high-availability environment:

Hypervisor: Proxmox VE Cluster (2-Node)

Environment: Debian 12 LXC

Process Management: PM2 (Ensuring 99.9% uptime)

Reverse Proxy: Nginx (Gateway for mochajoe.dev)
